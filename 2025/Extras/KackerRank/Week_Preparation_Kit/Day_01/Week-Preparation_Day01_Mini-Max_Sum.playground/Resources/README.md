# Mini-Max Sum

## ***Problem Description***
Given five positive integers, find the **minimum** and **maximum** values that can be calculated by summing exactly ***4 of the 5 integers***.

Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

### ***Examples***
<ins>Example 01:</ins>

`arr = [1,3,5,7,9]`

The **minimum sum** is `1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16` and **the maximum sum** is `3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 24`.
The function prints
```
16 24
```

<ins>Example 02:</ins>

`arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

Sample Output:
```
10 14
```
